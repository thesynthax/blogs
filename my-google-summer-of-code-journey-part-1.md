## My first failed attempt at GSoC (The history)

It’s 2018, I’m in class 10th, scrolling YouTube, and I stumble upon Google Summer of Code. I used to watch many videos related to software development back then. I am immediately fascinated by the program (initially, honestly, due to the crazy $5500 stipend it used to offer). I was bummed that students under 18 could not participate, but I decided **I had to do it at least once during my undergrad.**

Fast forward to **early 2023**, my 2nd year of B.Tech. This was the first time I actually tried to understand what it takes to get accepted into GSoC. I started watching videos about GSoC, checking out organizations, **digging into old proposals online**, and getting overwhelmed by the details and technicalities mentioned in those proposals. At this point, I was wading here and there, without any clear goals for my target organization, my choice of tech stack, or even whether I wanted to do GSoC. **I didn’t have the programming and soft skills** back then to even think about cracking GSoC (I will talk more about my technical journey in the upcoming blogs).

Moving on to **December 2023**, I was into Full-stack Web Development. Again, **I binged too many videos** on YouTube about “how to crack GSoC”. But this time, my motivation had shifted. It wasn’t the stipend anymore, but the love for open-source (more about it in the upcoming blogs). I genuinely wanted to fulfill my dream from 5 years ago, contribute something meaningful to the organizations, and **put my skills to good use**.

Here’s the problem, though: **I watched too many videos that were catered to the Indian audience**. The problem with that is that most of these videos talk about cracking GSoC as if it is some competition (**JEEfication of GSoC**), but very few of them actually talk about the fundamentals that must be focused on to get accepted in GSoC; most talk about the tips and tricks. They say you must start very early (**by September-October**) to get into GSoC, which I feel is untrue. I have seen many people around me getting accepted in just two months. I’d be lying if I said I did not use some of these “tips and tricks.” However, if you focus on the fundamentals, **show that you are worth something**, and communicate effectively, you will almost definitely be accepted.

So anyway, I started shortlisting organizations according to my tech stack (It was MERN, xD. I didn’t have much choice because I only knew Game Development apart from that). I came across this golden website: [gsocorganizations.dev](https://gsocorganizations.dev). I selected all the years from 2018 to 2023, ensuring these organizations will return to GSoC in 2024 (not always, but yeah). **I selected the relevant technologies, topics, and categories** in the filter. I had a list of organizations at this point, namely Rocket.Chat, Zulip, Sugarlabs, and Oppia. I went with **Rocket.Chat**.

The thing I liked about Rocket.Chat was that their **communication** system was top-notch. It used to happen on the Rocket.Chat application itself, and they created a channel for each of the project ideas that they listed. They were extremely welcoming to the community. By February 2024, I attended their meetings to learn how to create a Rocket.Chat app. In March, I started **contributing** to their projects, mainly to **EmbeddedChat**. I contributed because:

1. Every YouTube guru said that you need to have at least 2-3 months of contributions to the organization in which you want to get accepted. I had only 2-3 weeks left before the deadline.
2. Rocket.Chat created a leaderboard that showed the number of open PRs, merged PRs, and issues you’ve opened. You can check it out at [gsoc.rocket.chat](https://gsoc.rocket.chat).

I had mixed feelings about the leaderboard because it felt unnecessary. Anyway, I contributed mostly **small to medium-sized issues**, opened about **7 PRs, and 4 got merged**, bringing my ranking to 15 out of 200 contributors. Felt okay about it, but not great, because the top 5 people had like 15 merged PRs and were bound to get accepted.

That year, they had a bunch of AI/LLM integration project ideas. I picked “**Chat thread summarizer using AI**”. And here’s where I messed up: I didn’t use my time wisely. **I focused on contribution too much** and didn’t actually work on my proposal until the **very last day** (I know it's foolish).

April 2, 2024, I woke up early and started building my proposal. Some ideas and **implementation details** were discussed in this project’s channel, but **I barely talked to the potential mentor** about the details, and I just started writing independently. I wrote whatever I knew could be relevant to the project, why it could be helpful, the implementation details, the timeline, the future work, etc. Honestly, **the proposal wasn’t strong**. I missed a lot of details.

Meanwhile, this other guy who joined in March skyrocketed to rank 3 in just days and picked the same project idea. Looking at his contributions, I already knew he was going to beat me. Still, I wanted to at least finish and submit. At 6:30 pm (deadline was 11:30 pm), I submitted my proposal and called it a day.

It’s May 1, 2024, and the results are announced. I knew **I wasn’t going to get selected**. And guess what… I did not get selected.

That same guy got selected. I reached out to him and asked if he’d share his proposal. He did. And I was blown away. For what seemed like a small project, he had written a **super-detailed proposal**, covering every corner, but he was right in doing so, trying not to miss any details. I learnt a lot from his proposal and this journey. I just moved on to improve more.

What did I learn?

1. **Stop binging videos** and chasing “tips and tricks”.
2. Focus on the fundamentals. Improve tech skills. Contribute. S**how your worth. Communicate**.
3. Proposal vs Contributions? Honestly, depends on the org. If you’re unsure, focus on both equally.

### Stay tuned for the comeback in the next part!
